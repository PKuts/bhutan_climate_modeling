# ERA5 Bhutan Climate Dataset (2000â€“2025)

This dataset contains hourly ERA5 reanalysis data for Bhutan from the years **2000 to 2025**, organized by variable. The data is used for climate modeling and extreme weather prediction (e.g., floods, glacial lake outburst events).


## Variables Included

- `2m_dewpoint_temperature`
- `2m_temperature`
- `10m_u_component_of_wind`
- `10m_v_component_of_wind`
- `potential_evaporation`
- `snow_depth`
- `snowmelt`
- `soil_temperature_level_1`
- `sub_surface_runoff`
- `surface_runoff`
- `surface_solar_radiation_downwards`
- `total_precipitation`

Each `.grib` file contains hourly data for a specific year and variable over the Bhutan region.
