# Bhutan Climate Modeling

🌏 This repository is part of [Omdena's local chapter challenge](https://www.omdena.com/chapter-challenges/leveraging-ai-to-combat-climate-change-in-bhutan), focused on leveraging AI to combat climate change in Bhutan.

We aim to model climate patterns and predict extreme events such as glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) through collaborative, data-driven analysis.

This repo includes data, code, and outputs for:
- Analyzing historical meteorological patterns across Bhutan
- Identifying seasonal and regional climate trends
- Supporting predictive modeling of extreme weather events


## 📁 Repository Structure
